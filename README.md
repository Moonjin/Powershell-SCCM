# Powershell-SCCM

The scripts in this repo were created (mostly by me) as I worked over a few years. The quality will vary as I taught myself PS with no previous coding experience. They were all created for practical reasons so may be of use to other SCCM admins. Most are written to work with 2008 R2 servers and newer meaning PS v2. This is so the script will run on any server but I find writing the code out using PS v2 syntax, $_ for example,  helps me understand what the code is actually doing.

The code has also been cleaned up so I don't expose my companys internal workings. I will endevour to make it so the script still makes sence.

Most scripts have explanations and notations. for example 
-#    # This is a powershell script.

If anyone finds this usful it has been worth uploading.
